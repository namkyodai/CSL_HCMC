# CityScope Platform for Urban Planning - An Application in HCMC, Vietnam
This respository contains a complete set of data used for the evaluation, analysis, and simulation with the CityScope platform developed by the MIT Media lab.

Description of metadata, queries, and codes is provided in the Wiki page.

Respository is comprising of three main folders

1. Input
2. Code
3. Output

Input folder contains only primary source of data in tabular, JSON, or geospatial formats. Source of data might come from various surveying reports.

It is important to note that all files saved under this folder are considered to be ORIGINAL files.

Code folder contains a series of syntaxes organized in steps/orders, with clear description for project members to follow. The idea is that once the code is executed, analytical outputs, simulation outputs can be visible. In addition, a certain number of codes might be used to generate output files, which can be used as input files for the simulation.

Output folder contains generated files from excuting codes and files generated by using other tools for the purpose of study. It is highly recommended that members of the data team shall provide a clear description for output files and how to arrive at the values presented under each attribute of the output file.
